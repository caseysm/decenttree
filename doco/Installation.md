<h1>Installing decenttree</h1>
<h2>MacOS</h2>
On MacOS, the decenttree executable is statically linked, so it is ready to run as is (once you unzip it with gzip -d).

<h2>Windows</h2>
On Windows, the decenttree executable is dynamically linked, with Open MP link libraries, so you will need to ensure that those are in the path.
