//                Uses *square* matrices (rather than triangular matrices)
//                (square matrices make the program simpler, and gives its
//                 memory access patterns better spatial locality of reference,
//                 at the cost of doubling the memory requirements).
//                Calculations are "moved left of the summation" wherever possible
//                (the formulae used are equivialent to those in [GAS2009], but
//                with calculations moved outside of for-loops wherever possible,
//                and function calls avoided as much as was practicable).
//
//  UNJ   implementation based on a 1997 paper.
//        Paper: "Concerning the NJ algorithm and its unweighted version, UNJ",
//               Olivier Gascuel
//        TAG:   [GAS1997]
//        Class: UNJMatrix<T>
//        Note:  Subclass of NJMatrix.
//               UNJ's name ("unweighted...") is a bit misleading.
//               To recover the "unweighted" contributions of the taxa in
//               two clusters of sizes s1 and s2 it is necessary to reweight
//               contributions from both (e.g. d = d1*s1/(s1+s2) + d2*s2/(s1+s2)),
//               where d1 and d2 are distances from another cluster (cluster 3)
//               to clusters 1 and 2.
//               This makes UNJ slower than NJ, in partice.
//
// The vectorized implementations (of BIONJ and NJ) use Agner Fog's
// vectorclass library.

 * @note   The textbook implementation uses formulae that feature

 *         implementation calculates "scaled" row totals, which are
 *         row totals, U', multiplied by (1/(n-2)), so simpler
 *         formulae of the form Dij-U'i-U'j rather than (n-2)Dij-Ui-Uj,
 *         can be used (since we're just comparing magnitudes to determine
 *         which pair of clusters to join, it doesn't matter if those 
 *         magnitudes are all rescaled.
 *         This trick saves a multiplication on every evaluation, at the
 *         cost of row_count multiplications (to calculate U' from U)
 *         per iteration.
